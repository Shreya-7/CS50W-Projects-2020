This project is a **\*fangirl alert*** studio album-directory page for Grammy-winning musician John Mayer.
It demonstrates some basic CSS layout features along with examples of SASS and Bootstrap.
It is a responsive webpage and has been tested on various screen sizes.

#### This project contains:

* **index.html** - the home page from which we can navigate to other pages.
* All pages can be located from all other pages. To navigate to the home page, click on the first photo on the left.
* **style.scss** - the styling for the pages, compiled into "style.css".
* Six other .html pages, one for each album.

#### Improvements needed:

* Spacing between album divs.
* Fitting in a single page without scrolling.
* Some kind of templating so that common HTML can be reused.
* Fetching album and song details from the Internet.
