This project is an studio album-directory page for Grammy-winning musician John Mayer.
It demonstrates some basic CSS layout features along with examples of SASS and Bootstrap.
It is a responsive webpage and has been tested on various screen sizes.

This project contains:

1. "index.html" - the home page from which we can navigate to other pages.
2. All pages can be located from all other pages. To navigate to the home page, click on the first photo on the left.
3. "style.scss" - the styling for the pages, compiled into "style.css".
4. Six other .html pages, one for each album.

Improvements needed:

1. Spacing between album divs.
2. Fitting in a single page without scrolling.
3. Some kind of templating so that common HTML can be reused.
4. Fetching album and song details from the Internet.
